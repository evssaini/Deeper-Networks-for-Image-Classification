# Deeper-Networks-for-Image-Classification
Python code for Deeper Networks for Image Classification

This report details an experiment study on applying and evaluating deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs) for image classification tasks using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. The project focuses on implementing and comparing two CNN architectures that are VGG16 and ResNet18. The study involves training these networks under different conditions, including training from scratch, for simpler MNIST dataset and utilizing transfer learning with pre-trained weights for the more complex CIFAR-10 dataset. The report describes the methodologies used for data loading, preprocessing, model building, training and evaluation. Results, supported by training logs, loss curves, and accuracy curves are presented and evaluated properly. A critical analysis of the pros and cons of each architecture based on their performance and training characteristics on the chosen datasets. The report highlights the impact of design of architectures and transfer learningâ€™s effectiveness alongside the advance training techniques used to achieve high accuracy on image classification.

This mini project aims to provide hands on experience in applying such architectures on datasets mentioned above and evaluating these deep CNNs for image classification. The objectives are:
1.	Implement and train VGG16, ResNet18 for image classification.
2.	Utilize the MNIST dataset and an addition dataset, called CIFAR-10, to evaluate the networks.
3.	Perform and evaluate the classification tasks, including monitoring the training process and quantitatively assessing the results.
4.	Conduct a critical analysis of the models chosen, based on their architectural principals and experimental performance.

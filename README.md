# Deeper-Networks-for-Image-Classification


## 📌 Overview

This report details an experimental study on applying and evaluating deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. The project focuses on implementing and comparing two CNN architectures: VGG16 and ResNet18. The study involves training these networks under different conditions, including training from scratch, for the simpler MNIST dataset and utilising transfer learning with pre-trained weights for the more complex CIFAR-10 dataset. The report describes the methodologies used for data loading, preprocessing, model building, training and evaluation. Results, supported by training logs, loss curves, and accuracy curves, are presented and evaluated properly. 
A critical analysis of the pros and cons of each architecture based on their performance and training characteristics on the chosen datasets. The report highlights the impact ofthe  design of architectures and transfer learning alongside the advanced training techniques used to achieve high accuracy on image classification.
